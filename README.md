## IMPORTANT TO READ - CONFIGURATIONS

- (frontend) The IP address of the API is statically set to the following IP: 192.168.0.171:9090. This can be changed in the services.dart file on line 12. This implies of course to rebuild the project -> impossible to change in the APK.
- (backend) The configurations of the connection between the API and the database can be modified in the application.properties file.
